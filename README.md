### Hey, i occasionally do stuff and things
- Currently editing/working on JSON files to include more content for maptool. (thanks rtakehara for making a framework)
- Will slowly learn to do stuff when time permits. Current goals are to make a simple game and my own linux "distro"

Thats it. Not much special happening here. Pure hobbies
